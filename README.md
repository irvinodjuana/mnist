# MNIST
MNIST implementations from scratch

## Overview
The MNIST problem is a famous image classification problem based on the MNIST dataset - a collection of tens of thousands of handwritten digits from 0-9. In this repo, I have implemented five ML models from scratch using Python and NumPy. 

Please note that some of the utility functions and specialized optimization routines are taken from The University of British Columbia's CPSC 340 course assignments. 

## Performance
| -m | Model Name | Accuracy |
| --- | --- | ---|
| 1.1 | KNN | 96.8% |
| 1.2 | Logistic Regression | 96.3% |
| 1.3 | SVM | 96.7% |
| 1.4 | Multi-layer Perceptron | 98.0% |
| 1.5 | CNN | 95.0% |
